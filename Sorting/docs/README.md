## [Bubble Sort]()
***Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are in the intended order. Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise up to the surface, each element of the array move to the end in each iteration. Therefore, it is called a bubble sort.  `Complexity: O(n^2)`***

## [Selection Sort]()
***Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list. `Complexity: O(n^2)`***

## [Insertion Sort]()
***Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration. `Complexity: O(n^2)`***
